	\item Should a company be able to afford the initial costs of automating complex manual workflows and applying Continuous Integration concepts to increase efficiency, they should.
	
	\item Other software development methodologies should be inspected to see if there are other concepts that would aid in the development of automated workflows.
	
	\item At least one co-op student from an engineering program should be given the project of actually applying and testing these concepts on some complex workflows.
