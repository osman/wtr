Dis, je suis en train de recevoir des messages pour le théâtre et c'est là que je me rends compte que la date de la représentation approche à grands pas. 
Tu crois que l'age pourrait tenir le bar alors? Si vous pouviez le faire ce serait vraiment bien. 
Si tu pouvais me dire quoi, comme ça je pourrai le dire aux profs dimanche pendant la représentation. 

Merci et à lundi!

my mom never told you? after 2 weeks of having a new car, my dad, jaxsyn, and i were in the car taking me to school, we were crossing the 31 bridge and we hit a full size semi tire, we almost flipped over, blew out two tires and bent two rims on the passenger side, bottomed out, and messed up the alignment pretty bad. 3 other cars behind us hit it too. there was a full sized ford truck behind us, and it punctured its gas tank, so there was gas all over the highway. because it was too dangerous to be around the gas, i had to sit in the back seat of a cop car with jaxsyn until the mess was cleaned up. then a firetruck gave us a ride to the rendzevous, then kim picked us up and dropped me off to school, dropped my dad off at work, and dropped jaxsyn off at her mom's. so yeah, it was one CRAZY morning

What would I do without my jojo!? :)
hi rana gud to see u on face book ....sure u r goin to get hooked to it .
question for you...since you are involved in 2009 POTK...I am hopeful you can help. Katey was upset b/c she and Katlynn Hansen were both told that they would not be performing or sitting with the rest of the 5th grade?  In the past, performances were arranged by grade, they said they are performing after the third grade, but before the fourth, and sitting on the opposite side of the auditorium.  I am not the parent volunteer for this group, Jamie Hansen is, but she has not heard back from Bobbie or Stan, and asked me to intervene.  They are scheduled to perform before intermission. Any idea what is going on...THANKS!!
Happy Birthday, girl!  Hope it is a great day for you!
I love you too!  :-)  We're glad you're coming home!
Yoi, saking setia kawannya tuh rai. Hahaha.
what day you home for summer missy?
mmm baby

Hi!  I would LOVE to - but tomorrow night isn't good for me (I have too much to do in this house that I have been totally neglecting) - next week would be great!!!! How about Monday, Tuesday, Wed or THursday night (next Friday is Good Friday and I don't feel right about having a few that night!).  Let me know which night is good for you.  I will make sure I go to the bank before we go so I'm not locked in the bank at night - that was so funny!  Let me know - I can't wait!

Probably won't move full time.  Just have a weekend place.
my crazy ex fucking deleted my fb and changed my passwords on everything and all my emails and he shut my phone off...
There's value in suffering. The persons involved just emerge stronger. God bless. You'll be fine. *hugs xoxo

Hey, thanks!  Dani and I were in Logan last weekend, so it woulda been kinda difficult to meet up here.  We went for my b-day and Easter, and to start looking for apartments.  We wer accepted to USU.  I feel lame for not telling you that earlier.  We'll be moving up there at the beginning of next month, right after I graduate from Snow.  BTW, my phone # is (435)610-0085, and Dani's is (435)881-2106.  Also, I love the little thing you have in your "About Me" box.  It's pretty much true, except you never really drove me crazy.  Anywho, I gotta get to bed so's I can get up for classes tomorrow.  Love ya, Ashley!  See you 'round!

Yes, thanks for the info and I hope I am writing in the right place here! I understand the finances of the move, but oh, I hate to think of Erie without the soda fountain! Not just any but that RED one, :)

I DID find my Fleming book. I wonder what is incorrect in it and why. It was done nearly 40 years ago so I would think a nice history would be due. Hum, will have to think about that. Arcadia printings would be $20...think enough Erie people would pay that?:)

This is such a cold and dark Easter....think I will curl up with a book with what is left of the day.....c
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHHAA... woww lmfao what if that was? i would cry
Lol girl you'll hate it!! I just kno we'd still have fun, we always do! Its a Friday night in TO, so if ur really down let me kno!! If not thats okay too babe, just thought I'd ask:) See you this weekend sexy girl;)xo

Hi, Jimmy.  Thank you for your help this weekend.  Maureen wanted me to let you know what my parent's song was, it's "Band of Gold" by Don Cherry.  It's available on itunes.

You little wild woman you!  I miss you!  When are you coming to visit?  How is your mom?  I am getting ready to pay for my next cruise.  We are going with a group of people we cruised with in December.  There were about 14 of us.  We are all signing up for January 2010.  So far there are 10 of us and growing.  Some of my kids are going.  Can you believe Jared is going to be a daddy?  Ouch.  Daniel made me a grandma last year in July.  She (Madison Haleigh Bishop) is absolutely gorgeous.  I love her to death.  She really little (petite) but already getting ready to walk.  She can say bubble, dada, and of course, mama.  I just want to pinch her to make sure she's real.  She is so cute.  You need to look at all of her pics on my facebook.  Grandma is crazy about her.  Come see us very soon.  val
Thank u

JE DÉVIERGE TON MUR HAHAHHAHA.

Bon je vais t'écrire un texte en même temps.  Odélie est une fille.  J'crois.  Elle va à l'école Joseph-François Perrault, à Montréal.  Elle est assez bizarre, avec des interets louches comme se lever à 6h du matin pour pratiquer sa flûte dans son sous-sol, mais tout le monde l'aime pareil.  Elle, comme moi, est très complexé et aimerais changer en quelqu'un de meilleur.  Elle se demande : «Pourquoi?».  Mais c'est vrai.  Pourquoi?  Une question qui ne pourra jamais être répondue.  Elle avait le cheveux longs, comme vous voyez dans certaines de ses photos dans l'album intitulé "photographies inutiles", mais elle les a coupé, pour quelque chose de plus court et plus «fwoosh», comme je dirais.  Je crois que mon commentaire commence à être trop long, et que je ne pourrai jamais écrire assez pour tout la décrire, donc allez la connaître vous même.
haha why? amazon has a bunch.

EXCEPT she isn't sure if she's going to be showing her friend and her friend's friend around town but she THINKS she can make it. are you guys planning on drinking at life? we thought it might be a good idea to go to meet up at life and then go to a parrilla or something and just get some fast food and cheap liquor there, so as to avoid being borachas at life. what do you think?
Well i dont know, you might think he is yummy :P HA!!

Adek, Happy Birthday yah!

Go here and watch the special announcement: http://www.smosh.com/
Yeah, it's been awhile. I've been super busy with everything. My sister just had a baby so I was out of town helping her out. I'm doing really well though. What's new with you?
This is so neat.  I'm glad my boyfriends daughter talked me into doing it.  I'm actually working two jobs.  I work full-time for a fiber optic company doing mostly administrative work, and I also host at a restaurant called Hoppers in Midvale at night.  If we ever get custody of my boyfriends kids I'd love to be able to stay home with them and if we weren't paying the child support, we could afford for me to do that.  My full time job is actually in North Salt Lake, Bountiful area, so we're close.  I wish I could plant a garden, but we live in a condo with a very small patio, so not a whole lot of room, I'll rely on my parents for that part of it I guess.  If it every gets warm enough to actually do anything.
Woo hoo - the Tarheels rock!!!!
i hope to the high heavens that you are NOT wasting tonight.
12 am baby, get your legal arse out on the town.
and then in the coming weeks, when i have a little dosh, we're gonna have a BD night.
correct?
correct.
enjoy tonight my dear
x.
hey wheres all ur flair?!?!?! ttyll
No, no, no, you are misunderstanding.  I am commenting on the hotness level of the pciture thanks to my incredible side-boob.  You know, Peter Griffin's side boob hour?  And, plus, you're rocking out to some tunes with your fist in the air which is obviously awesome.  OH my gosh that just reminded me of the Spain picture that Mark is making that insane face.  I'm going to go look at it now.
Happy Birthday Merri! Hope you have a great one. See you Saturday.
Why is "making babies cry" one of your interests?????? lol

Glad to know you had a wonderful stay in Chicago. My youngest sister, Jennie, frequents Chicago quite often and she loves it there. Well, goodluck to your home improvement task. Hope everything is according to schedule. If it's not, so what?! LOL! Seriously, don't put too much pressure on yourself. I'm sure Greg & the kids will understand if you're a bit delayed. We'll be in Singapore for 6 days. Looking forward to taking the kids there :)

Thanks.  Pretty good.
Um yeah his name is scott I believe. Haha.
I hadn't seen it until now - it's interesting - thanks for sharing.   As you can probably guess, this doesn't surprise me in the least.  This weekend the great leader also discussed living in a world where we don't need nuclear weapons, while NK simultaneously launched a test missile and while both NK & Iran continue to build nuclear weapons.

I'm not sure where he gets his ideas, but they don't seem based in reality.

& BTW - The answer to the question of who's to blame UK, France, China, US... the answer is everyone.  Because, while the recession has effected everyone in a similar ways, the reasons differ by country as the amount of regulations, the continuation of central banks to keep money cheap, domestic versus international demand.... all  these things and more differ from country to country.   

The interdependence of course has helped ever country "hurt" other countries, but the alternatives of isolation and protectionism will hurt much worse than continuing free trade.

i really want to apply to be in survivor now. that would be your favorite season ever! except you'd totally have to teach me all the good strategies for alliances & shit .. i feel like i'd get totally owned .. 

we absolutely have to avoid going to disneyworld in june, july & august .. it would be awfully full of pesky little schoolchildren! come onnnn your reading week! YES!!

i unfortunately have just gotten online without being occupied by something else .. tonight was a surprisingly busy night for no good reason .. raincheck? i would come on skype, but it's almost 2:30 in the morning & i'm actually pretty tired .. WHOOOOOP!

Hey there! How's the transition going?you'll never guess who I saw (Noooo, not HIM haha) -- working out at LA Fitness- Kim & April! They said they walked into Crunch Tuesday and they had a sign up that said they were closing on Thursday! 2 lousy days notice! And they deducted their dues for the month, too! What a racket that place turned out to be. Oh well- when the place was up to par, it was good times and good workout buddies, that's for sure. Let me know how things are going. : )
SPERO..hehe
i sneezed 7 times today :-)
I'm still around chica...just busy.  I'll pass on the love to Anna.  Get your butt down here soon!

Happy birthday Arbor... GBU Always (donny & vera)
Thanks for your help AND the congratulations. And yes, the show as a whole was nothing short of kickass. Is it just me, or is the dance now hardwired into our genetic material? Johnny B. Goode was my sisters' favorite, by the way.

Hey Cuz! Whaz up with you? How was your weekend and how is your week going? Your questions are no where near too random either;) To answer your question about sushi, I have never tried it before, the smell and appearance of it has always scared me away. I do not watch Lost, but I don't understand how they can kill a character off and then bring them back, not very realistic, are you a fan? Oh, and Rugby is supposedly half chow chow half basset hound, weird combination, and she looks like neither of these. Have you ever eaten squid? What is your favorite color? Are you a fan of the Office?
Miss you more  <:X Dawn Kasper>
ugh ya money is such a challenge with any kids.. but i dont know how you do it just with two haha. mia is good.. she is so crazy she cracks me up. the cpk isnt open yet but they took applications and are still doing construction..

That wasn't exactly the information I was talking about. But that works as well. I'm not working right now, so NKOTB and Jabba may have to wait. What are you doing tonite?

Ay bestie. So, SORRY for things such as never being around lately- I miss home. Aka your house.....And your bed ;-) even if it does break multiple times while we sleep in it - and not going on vacation. I could have been tan with you! Grr! Lo siento. But hey hey hey, I'm looking into possibly blessing myself with your presence tomorrow night? It's a possibility. Where will you be? We should rent a hot tub or something because I'm dying to get in some wa-wa ASAP. I don't even want to guess when the last time I was at your house was. Oh wait, we worked out and ran together! :-). Oh, 16th birthday = 1 month away. OH HALES YAYES. What should we do babyg?
Okay you best address all of these issues I brought up.
P.S. Have you been reading fmylife.com?

You totally could have used it as a source...and it was actually really interesting. Anyways...have lots and lots of fun in New York!! I wish you could bring me in your suitcase with you but...I think it would be considered overweight and you would have to pay that annoying fine at every single luggage check. hahah So...basically it'd be cheaper if you just use that money to buy me a ticket...thanks. hahah <3

Our church does Easter in the park, the battlefield.  We usually do that, but it may be too cold to take the girls out this year.  Work is good, it's only 2 nights a month, so not bad.  How is the NICU and how's your dad doing?  We do need to get together soon.  My mom fell and broke her shoulder in 4 places and is having surgery today.  Always something.  Maybe next week we can get together.

Nå kjente jeg ørlite grann til trøtthet, så natti, natti......Åh det skal bli godt...........kjenne hode mot puta, dyna som begynner å varme en sliten kropp og søvnen som kommer sigende..........deilig...................................
Ga juga baek,,,alhamdulillah......

What an evil april fools joke! LOL! Ya, I need things to keep myself occupied in France besides school and I have always liked running, just never really "went the distance" so I figured it would be a really great goal and if all goes well....maybe a marthon, or triathalon. I haven't signed up for a semi yet cause I want to wait until I get to a comfortable 10K speed....I am thinking doing a 10K this summer then semi this fall....they have a lot of semi-marathons during the fall here in France and you can run the vineyard routes!!....so being that I am obsesssssed with wine....what better idea!
Yay! I am super excited. Tuesday??? I have olsens class, well I am supposed to but you know olsen! Lets do it before traffic hits me on my way home!!!

Hi Miss Douglas! Remember me?
Well, I suppose 8 months is better than a year.  Let me know if you need anything at all while you're gone!  Yeah...I'm sure Hawaii has just been blustery!  SD gets chilly at night, but that's about it.  Hopefully you'll get more golf in before you head out.   I also hope that the "men" (I still think of them as boys!) aren't driving Judy to drink!!!  ;-)  Glad they're all well.

story of your life
I went back to our bar here in the hotel last night and talked about the Army, politics and you (not necessarily in that order) with about 4 people who were there. One guy remembered you and said I was the luckiest guy he ever met. He said that your "Julia Roberts smile" pretty much grabs hold of you and reels you in. (Was he reading my notes?)

Hi Murray



You are not going to believe what happened today. My car got hit again coming off the highway at Sobey's new headoffice. A woman ran a red light and hit my right bumper and we just got the car back Saturday.Her car has alot more damage then mine but I am just sick about it! Your father doesn't even know about it yet. I think I'm having a run of bad luck!! So how was your day?



Love 



Mom

Mi niño grande hoy cumple 14...Dios te me bendiga siempre ..que Tio vive orgulloso de lo inteligente y lo que has logrado..que mama es una titana y voy a ella y pago el doble...y ha echo un excelente trabajo en la creianza de sus hijos.....Y como parte de los seis pedazos de mi corazon eres tan importante para mi como los otros cinco sobrinos que Dios me regalo...Muchas felicidades y ya tienes edad para lavarme el carro...jaajajaj
happy birthday (:
What you mean, yourself? Ive been working there since last summer, i do reception on Fridays when Margaret isn't there, and other random shit on Wednesdays. Just wondering if i'd have to put up with YOU for another summer... Haha :) x
it was barrack or O.j Simpson
Hey Bill!  Dad sent it to me this morning and it was framed. You will have to ask him.
Da jeg skulle gifte meg med Scott, var jeg sikker på at Jens August var død. Men jeg og Scott ble aldri gift, fordi jeg fikk vite på vår egen bryllupsdag at det var han som prøvde å drepe Jens August. Dobbeltsjekk detaljer før du angriper meg slik!

Når det gjelder Alexander må han få lov til å ha sex med hvem han vil. Han er jo ikke i noe forhold. Vi er da voksne mennesker?
Hi Sandy!It was great to hear from you, hope to see you guys sometime soon.  Tell the girls we say hi.

Hey. So I've asked for my ipod a few times now and you're not responding s0oo0 I don't know what's up with that... and I really need it. I'm leaving wednesday for Mass and I can't be in a car for that long with nothing to do. So if you could get it to me by like tuesday that'd be cool. or if it's a problem getting it to me here, I can meet up with you or get it at your house or whatever. I have my license so it's no big deal.
merci awee ya nermine for ur message

I can just see it above the couch Just making a statement! It sure does on your fb wall. !!! ( there, there is the comment again about that gun again.)

ya i found my self a guy, trying to get a job, blah blah blah. you still with that one girl? how is your mom and sister?
the third part about u being a busy girl that wud be the part i am referring too.

yes..u have explained ur facebook issues already...im starting to feel like ur insecure about social networking sites. :p

or maybe she just has a thing for brilliant students...i like how u instantly assume drugs...which leads me to ask some questions in my head.

thanks for the help on that book...cuz now without the name i can definitely go out and get a copy.

never thought i wud see an E-mail craze coming.

theres just something about everyone knowing ur the greatest basketball player to ever walk the face of the earth. i think he wud be happy with that.and that williams sisters thing is really wierd.

thank u dr.phil. i never realized how psychoanalytical u cud be. actually the goal of my statement was to summarize ur entire mj argument. i talked about the 1st...chose not to discuss the 2nd since u said u didnt remember that one..and then explained the 3rd. nice try though.
Yeah...ive actually regressed. FML. haha

oh welllllll. hey- lets play remember when.

remember when my life is a joke and should be written about for other people's entertainment.
<3
Oooooh i can never ask for more, having u as my sister is a prefect gift from God that anyone can ask for.~~MUAH~MUAH~~I LOVE U MORE..

What extreme sport are you talking/thinking about???
HAPPY BIRTHDAY STEVE!! hope you have a good one!!! liking the profile pic....(loves young dream) lol x
lol i know and it seems the more i whine about that stupid "favorite 5" thing the more of them show up so i'm trying to contain myself, anyway i'm doing pretty good, i graduate from college in a month so thats pretty exciting, i dont know what i'll do after other than to try to find a job, i just applied with the Manitowoc Police Department so it would be pretty cool if that worked out, otherwise i'm working at a gas station (kwik trip) and working at the YMCA, i'm not exactly sure how the rest of my family is doing lol cause i moved out in january and i live with a friend, its only like 10 blocks from where i lived lol but whatever its nice to be on my own, other than that everything seems to be good, that would be awesome if you guys came down in july cause i havent seen you in pretty much forever, we definitely need to hang out at least once if you come, anyway how are things going with you, what have you been up to lately
are you coming for the summer?
Boooooo! I have to leave on Thursday!  I'll leave plenty of gin for you! No promises about vodka. Oh, and lots of my $$

How about anytime after 2 pm? I am glad that you get to work some extra hours this week. I am sure that will help out! Talk to you soon

check the event for all the details. But we've already changed it once, it would be too hard to change it again. I did know it's that day, but more people had issues with friday than saturday. spring fest is an all day thing so you can at least catch some of it, but if you'd rather go to the concert at night it's no big deal. I just need to know by tomorrow cuz that's when molly and I are assigning characters.
Happy Bday Danielle!!! Hope you have a great day!!

I am still a Ford guy type guy, and the Mustang is cool and all, but I have taken to driving hot Volvo's and other Ford's since HS.  Humm, the last 20 years, in a nutshell: 17 years as a computer geek, but I am a chef now, and I have lived in Santa Clara, Colorado Springs, and now back to Sacramento and in the same house I was in when we were in school.  You?

Hey Lisa how are you
Megan!
Verity, I found a babysitter for May 2nd. We're looking forward to going to Hamburger Mary's for your birthday! It sounds like a lot of fun! Our kids had a good Easter, not too much candy! Dane and I have been doing some spring cleaning/organizing...we've got the fever-spring fever that is! When it rains or sprinkles all day and is cold and yucky it motivitates us to clean! We hope you all had a happy and safe Easter too! Talk to you soon!
Maggie laughed he was amusing, she is blunt by nature and impulstive those tended to be taken the wrong way. She nodded"Oh really is that so? I guess I know where to find my groom since it's the "wedding town." "she teased, "Music what kind of music do you listen too?And what book were you going to read. Sorry if I sound lke Im interrorgating you, but I love music and reading. So "she pursed her lips, and shrugged her shoudlers
i still dont no wat happen mabe u can tell me cuz people keep telling diffrent things !!!!!!!!! -xx-
what's new?
love u bb
No baby yet.  I tried for your birthday to no avail.  Manu's ok.  They think his signs might be stress related.  He disagrees.  Now I'm just waiting to get Camille out of my ribs!
Yippee I'm finally cool! How's it going out in the middle of nowhere?
Hello, Carolyn!!  Great to 'see' you again!
Hope all is well with you!

Hey girl, let me check it out with Corey, I'm sure any Friday is OK. I'm not feeling too well right now. Hope I'm not getting the stomach hibbie jibbies. I'll check in later. Will you be going to the therapy on Sat?

Yes, that's right--that was during one of those weeks I was muddling thru with about 1 hour sleep a night.  Yes--Mother wants them to be interested in the theater, and so do I--that's the reason they do Theater Arlington every summer.  Hopefully Jordan will have some time just to play around with them a little this summer and get them even more interested.

bonjour mon amie.
are you living on campus in Eugene? I guess i'm going to live on campus (IF i go there, I'm still waiting for answers from the scholarships) and the whole procedure and contracts and assignements and special halls and normal halls and rooms and roomates are confusing me...do you have skype? And do you have some time next week so we could meet and talk? And so I can ask you a million of questions and you can tell me after that how you are doing and what your life is like right now? 
allerliebste Grüße und Küsse, deine Mirjam

No....I still take Flintstones Kids...10 million strong and growing!  Hope ur having a great day!
Patsy ~ I am so sorry you found out about Mom's surgery on Facebook.  It was a HUGE blunder.  I screwed up.  I sincerely apologize.  I promise to make it up to you.  Please forgive we younger chica-biddies (who are really old biddies) because we have chicken brains.  And probably chicken livers and most definitely chicken hearts.  Oh, let's face it.  I'm a whole fryer!  Plucked and everything yet still able to flap around the barnyard.  OHH!!!  That's it!  My head has been cut off!  See?  I don't even have a brain cuz my head is gone.  And here I am running like mad, willy-nilly around the yard, somehow still able to squawk... and apparently type.  Because we felt so bad we cut off our own heads.  (Pssst!  Nancy!  Get your behind on here and be a chicken with me!!!)  Please forgive this bunch of poor little headless, brainless chickens. We're so lame and so sorry.

I love you and again, I'm very sorry.

Bock. Bock.  Bawwwwwk.
Mind ur  own  businesss!! L  0  L

Thank you so much. By the way, your kids are hilarious
Do you still live there in Bainbridge?  Where at?  I still have my place out in climax. Man the rains has got to be a fear factor for everyone down there.

It would be nice to see you soon also.  I wish you could make it for our next jazz show April 25.  It will be good.  How is your aunt in Germany doing?  I hope well.  I'm going on a nice ride this weekend on the Harley.  Just a whole day relaxing in the beautiful sunshine.  Take care sweetie
hey grl. misss youuuu!!!! too kisses and hugs, Becky.

We really did have the best time!  Paradise unfortunately it feels like I have never been away but I doubt I will get much sympathy from anyone!
Congrats on your debut!  I knew you'd do well, I had no doubt.  Deep inside, you're a Rog Woman.  Hope all is well.  Call me when the gigs get too big to handle.  I'd love to manage your road show.  Hugs to my baby girl.  XXOO
How's the job?  Are you working on the weekend?  Alice had a girl, Viviane.  
She says she's very sweet which makes sense with Ali as a mother:-)
Thank You!

I dunno, Norfside Harrow sounds pretty rocking to me. It's got its own tube station and everything! Yeah, I'm pretty good thanks. Slowly detoxing myself off a mixture of booze, easter egg and my own dodgy cooking. Nyum nyum.

Haha it's pretty normal to go a bit nuts as soon as you turn 18. Live it up some and just try not to be too noticeably plastered on the job. Either that or find a quiet corner to be hungover in.. x
Hi Birthday Boy! Sorry you're not in San Francisco for your birthday! Hope a celebratory Lemsip will hit the spot instead! xx

Jy beteken soooo baie vir my!! Ek bedoel dit! PPPP.....
The horses thought they were going to get to see Auntie Anita today.  Busa was so bummed that he decided to open the gate, climb onto the deck, shred every horsefeed bag he could find, and knock over the dog food bin and eat its contents.  The place is TRASHED!  He is evil!  Abi had absolutely NOTHING to do with it; she never does.
Hey Brooklyn!!! Did Matthias tell you I befriended him today? lol...I turned in my notice today..goodbye PIU :(
Cute, cute, cute!! I love those boys!
steve come pick up your application :)
I'm actually feeling pretty good, but getting very impatient with myself because I'm not healing as fast as I want to.  I've been up and walking around quite a bit and haven't been taking the pain meds much at all.  It has been nice not to worry about work, but I think I'll be ready to go back by Monday.  Hope you guys are having a great vacation!!!
I have the stuff.
Just checkin....I was getting a little scared and worried there for a minute.
Hahahahahahaha :) I expected something like that :P :P What are you doing later? Oh, talking to me, okay, great, bye xxxx
Epales! Feliz cumple, que la pases bien. Saludos!
I think of it as helping to get over your fears, not assassination  : )
jeg vet ikke om noe spess. er på hytten så må vite snarest om dere finner noe
Happy birthday bos...
Semoga selalu mendapat lindungan dan berkah Allah swt...
Scott - Isn't facebook weird !.  Review of last 25 years:  Dad stopped farming & sold the farm buildings for development (as you must have seen last year)  He and mum are now happy in retirement and trying hard to spend any inheritance !.  Jo is happily married with 2 kids (nursing in London)

I finished school, worked in summer camp in Texas and travelled the US.  University in London, medical graduate '97 - met Kim at Uni (married in 2000).  Then jobs in London, Brisbane, Bath, Oxford and now Melbourne.  Due to return to Oxford in December '09 (sports injury / knee surgery)
3 kids = Sam 6, Will 4 & Jasmine 1.

That's about it !

How's your family ?

We must catch up again in our early 60's !

So, it would have been great for us if it was William and Mary. Brendan decided on Washington and Lee. We didn't even bother going back to Emory. He had a great day there - a personal tour, meetings with professors in the business school and lunch with someone on the rugby team. By the time he was done it was decided. I don't think we are going to bother with Boston College or USC. I think tomorrow when we get home papers get filled out and a deposit mailed in. We were on our way home today and decided to detour and treat ourselves to a night at the Hershey Hotel. We just had a great dinner and Brendan is downstairs working out. Not that he can do much with his shoulder. I had planned on scheduling massages in the morning but forgot that with his shoulder he can't really have one. So a good night's sleep, a nice breakfast in the morning and then home. If the weather was nicer we could do Hershey Park. It was actually snowing today.
Great to see you here. Whats new?
happy birthday,
It was great talking to you also.  I am glad things are going good for you also.  I miss not seeing you as much as we did.
Hhoi........
You're a rock star, and I know it.  So does anyone else with a brain...

Hey Renee, glad you're back!  Chris and I would love to see you and Gary and hear all about your latest adventures.  We're heading to Arizona 4/23-4/26 for some much needed sun (although today was a nice dose!).  let's plan something when we get back.  I can't seem to talk Chris into joining facebook.  Have any ideas?  :)

Go to your Info page and add your schools and places where you worked. (If you want to). Then you will start getting notices about people that know you.
well, I'm just not a believer or a fan in governments if you haven't been able to tell.  I think we pay a lot of not so great people to do not so great things, and give them power that they abuse and are not deserving of.
newport you ?
oh yeah I actually downloaded a while ago and haven't seen yet.
guess it was really good eh?
k, i might watch it tonight.

Hey Lady... happy early b-day. Please do let me know if you stay up in the city on the 25. So, no, sadly, I will not be at the reunion thingy... I figure I see and catch up with all those I like from my past anyway. No need for me to go, ya know?
Well have a fab time if you go... keep me posted! Cheers...

Hi!  It's Duma Key by Stephen King  I really like it!  Have you read Water for Elephants?  That was really good.  Also liked The Time Traveler's Wife.  Sunday's at Tiffany's by James Patterson was a really quick, but good, read.  Have you read anything good lately?
soo....ROME WAS AMAZING!  I still wish that I could have been there whenyou guys were there, but oh well.  That city is incredible, I wish I was still there.  Except now that I am back only means the less time I have to wait to be in champaign so that we can be reunited :)
thanks, we had a bar Mitzvah.  Did you know the Shamwow guy got arrested for beating up a hooker?
Huaaaa you knowwww :p :p baru jadian nihh akuuuuuuu hihihi

Yep, I lived there for almost 5 years and all 3 of my sisters still live there (well, each in different suburbs) I went to college at Colorado Christian University in Lakewood, then lived in Denver, Arvada, Westminster and Littleton...yes I moved around a lot!  Each time I moved I could afford a little bit better apartment!  My boss had season tickets to the Rockies the 2 summers my hubby & I were dating we went to almost a game a week.  I still follow them religiously. My profile pic is from a World Series game we went to 2 yrs ago!  Good memories there!
I swear I saw a guy that looked JUST like you at Chick Fil A on saturday!

Nyima Chris.....how is life there? I'm sure u r so buzy with all the shoots. I admire you and your hubby for the school you established. It will be an outlet for all those poor children. You are too beautiful! I love the pics too. And your niece Alexia is so cute. She can follow her aunt's foot steps one day! I wish you a Happy Burmese New Year! Have a blast in Thingyan.
She is just being Hunter!  She really is my final exam and I'm not sure I'm going to pass!!!
Hey brotha......I had a great time chatting with ya the other night....you rock...!!!!!!!!!!!
hi lynn!!! good to hear from you!!!  been a long time!!!  you look great! still the same!!
So what do you think bout Cutler? I think he is from southern indiana, so he can't be that bad. Bears going to make that Superbowl run now yaaa baby!
wiidya???

apa kabar???
I am so glad that you have found me! I have often wondered about your family. You prob. wont read this right away...concidering you have a wedding tomorrow. Tell Chris I wish him the best. I can't believe it! Where do they go to college? Last time I saw you was right after.. was it Chris that left on his mission? 
We are in a very small town in Idaho called Challis. Everyone loves it here. It's okay for me. I tolerate it for the family sake. Theres alot to do...fishing, river rafting, hunting, motorbiking and 4-wheeling. We even have a riding trail in our yard going around our property with jumps and everything. The boys absolutely love it! I don't know if you remember Katelyn. She is a doll...and being that she is the only girl, the youngest, and has 3 older brothers she is definitly well loved!! Are John and Chris on facebook? 
So did Chris pick a good one to marry???? 
Best wishes,
Beth
dave matthews will be at jones beach july 21st and 22nd...we are goingggg...i wanna go to bothh haha

Yes we do...  I discovered facebook in the last couple months of my deployment.  It's a great way to keep in touch.  Things are good, other than I am gone for a military school for 3 months.  The boys are growing fast and I cant wait for Easter when I get to fly home and spend time with them and Cheryl.  Tell Kelly I said hello for me.

that is so exciting!i saw the pictures of the house and it is really pretty. that is crazy that the kiddos will be in 1st grade! wow! it really does seem like yesterday that they were born. how is your job? are you still at the lap band center? lots of people sure miss you at joco ob/gyn...me being one of them! nobody looks at my who-who quite like you did;) i would love to hear your toryn story. kirk and i have been trying for over a year now to have a baby but little success and lots of heartache. i know you know how that goes. but we are keeping our heads up and continuing to try. 
how is your family? are they liking oklahoma still?

Hey, I just got back from Puerto Rico. After all these years, I have finally found my brothers and sisters and met with my father. Can you believe it?

I saw Carlos over there and your name came up. So, I thought I would hunt you down and catch up. I can't believe it. Still living in the area? I see you have beautiful little girl. I am happy for you. 

You haven't changed a bit - which is good to see :)

Of cores but a mistake is a innocent. And laughing about mistakes is always better than feeling guilt. Its not true guilt its awkward. 

Although if your work had been noticed by someone who has survived a Nazi concentration camp then its not good to laugh. You know that. In fact its even better to apologize. 

Yeah that's what I think. And personality has nothing to do with it.
gd luck ar
OK, I will be around today.  Then court on Thurs.  Then leaving Friday.

Miss you too baby girl!
LOVAAA...go to bed so I can you see tomorrow thats not counting me waking up at the crack of dawn with my delightful family.  i think he took the hint...

Happy Birthday Jenney!!!
Abigail sighed at Camrens' question. "Well... I was supposed to be a sacrifice... my human body was just given to one of us, to take my blood... to feed from me. Then for years after he decided to change me instead of feed from me, I watched, and fed, from my own friends and family." She stopped and sucked in a breath. "I just couldn't take it I guess." She said softly.

Abigail smiled glad that the subject had changed momentarily. "You will have to go to Scotland it's beautiful there" She said softly. "A new mate! How exciting!" Abigail squealed. "So will you be settling here in Italy then?" She asked curiously, hoping to keep the subject off herself for the time being.
ps. We love you, and miss you all, and the Utah Lovell's enjoyed your visit!  :) (that last part was dad) :)

Happy birthday Liz...
Aiyoo .. Sayanggg .. Hha
I agree with loving to learn...I would go back to school just to audit courses. I had always planned to get my Masters Degree but I was busy with work and then kids. It's exciting to think that I can do whatever I want now...my husband, kids, house, etc. are set and stable. It's liberating being 40+ and knowing all my options are open...if I can dream it, I can do it.

First things first, I'll walk myself fit again. That is my five year goal...burn off all the kid weight and look like "me" again. I have loved staying home with my boys for the last 10 years...I felt it worked for all of us. It will be nice to work part time again for the money, adult interaction and intellectual interest. We'll see what I come up with. 

My boys (5 and 10) have had very good, rich lives. It's tough to adapt to one income but I hope that taught them humility, perspective and balance. I am the queen of Aldi, coupons and sales. If I can make them appreciative overall, I will have succeeded. :)
Dorry!  How are you?  Where are you? I hope I can catch u online one day so we can catch up!
ceuk si sendi. sibuk apa heeh? ga sibuk apaapa. kamu? gmana skolahnya? gmana juga kabar BUKU akuuu?????

HAHAH FUCK YOU. *pinky pinky. stupid idiot. gangster pose. fuck this morning all my tats and shit so hard to scrub off. all my rings and watch and shit still sorta on.
Apparently when my dad and I replaced the top to it (it's a convertible) he had cut a small piece of weather stripping to fit it and since it rained for three days straight the missing stripping = massive flooding :/
so my family went to deep creek lake and stayed at like the wisp hotel, but the room was sooooo small and i had to share a single bed with my super annoying little bro who moves, talks, and breathes heavily in his sleep. oh and he grinds his teeth soo i got no sleep
and then we went into this like discovery center which was filled with taxidermy (stuffed formerly alive animals) which made me SOOO uncomfortable, and i got really upset and none of my family really cared that it upset me which made me more upset
and then i tried to be helpful but all i got were "ohh be quiet" which made me feel even more upset and lonely
sooo we went hiking and i got some of my negative energy out, which helped a bit.....
and it really made me see how crappy my family is...not to mention how my mother is WAYYYY to controlling..
but yeahh i feel much better now that i saw most of my nava girlies, but im missing a very very important nava girly :)
haha. bosen ah yamin mulu.
yamin yg dmn dulu neh.
inbox me when u need someone to harvest your crops on the farm!

Carlton, I'm very new to this Facebook stuff, and am trying to find my way around in it.  Since sending my note, I found your profile, which tells me a lot.  I don't think I've seen you since high school - 47 years ago!  I can remember being in elementary school and wondering what the year 2000 might look like, should I live to see it.  Well, I did, nine years ago!  The whole things seems surreal!
Hey Susan, how are those exams coming?  Try to have some fun this week too!
happy birthday arif

YYYYYYYEEEESSSSSSS-  I married and move 3 miles down the road from where I have lived my entire life!  Still at Holly Grove Church!  Actually, I just gave up being the church treasurer last year after doing it for 5 yrs!  There was just no time to do it with the businesses, family and kids in school!  I am sooooo  sorry about your Dad!  He is one I have never forgotten!  But, I am glad to hear you are close to Mom!  Mike still looks the same!  So good to find you on facebook-your daughter is sooo cute!
Well, my Aunt Reenie and I are sitting here talking about you. She was telling me about a time you two played a song to Steve Prime. I was telling her about when we use to listen to Madonna "Papa Don't Preach" and would brush your hair that was down your back at the time. Remember those times?
There are alot of pics. of you on the Lake Normandy website.  Some are really cute-you have to show the girls.

I had a pretty fun holiday as well. I walked to Osaka from Kobe - it was about 30 kilometres or so and took 6 hours. The scenery on the way wasn't that good, but there was a pretty good sense of accomplishment.

Sorry for the long message, and for not writing so much - I'm back in uni now, so I'll be on the internet more (did I mention that I don't have proper internet access in my dormitory?).

hahaha, mental golf - good times indeed.

You are funny.  I just can't ever get the upper hand. Guess I should know better. It Is YOUR guest room to do with as you please: use it yourself, rent it out to others, or just leave vacant. It will be entirely up to you when you decide to come visit us-- by the way , you don't want to be fed or start crying in the middle of the night , do you?
Pizza night still on!! see you then. :)
Hey just finished breakfast in st.augustine :) haven't slept yet.what r you up to?

I am glad you made it to Iowa. You are such a nut to check your mail there! I am still stalking the store, maybe tomorrow I will cave and spend alot. You are probably not shopping there. Are you going to the Blue Bunny Ice Cream shop? Yummmmmmmmmmm!  I hope your birthday is wonderful on Sunday, even though you will be flying. And FYI, I did give Kevin the heads up about your birthday on Sunday. I will be curious to see if he still remembers. You will have to let me know. Have a good rest of your trip.
I would be available on Monday..if that works out for you. And sorry can't play tonight. Kathryn and I have plans.

it was great talking to you. we have to meet up soon -- a lot to catch up with. i do get some news of some our friends from college. do you know that sanjeev banerjee has become a calcutta high court judge? partha sen is finance manager with godrej or mahindra -- lives in bombay. srikanta is the most famous singer in calcutta. gora lives in bombay i think. sorry to hear about the news of mihirda. 
i'll try to como to joburg in june if you're there at that time. it'll be very nice to meet up after so many years. you also should try to come to london.

Nothing much! Working at Virginia Tech and raising Malachi. I wish I could see you guys. Its been such a long time. I email your dad sometimes however I NEVER hear anything from him. How is your mom? Your job sounds interesting. RL is one of my favorite designers. Keep in touch.
Thanks for the card... That's how I will look after having one of your mother's magic spring rolls. One bite and I am all patched up and feeling better!!!
I am doing very well.  A lot of things have happened since high school: graduated from college, got married, and had a baby.  Now I am a stay-at-home-mom and I absolutely love it!  What about you?  How have you been?  What has happened in your life during the last 10 years?  I see you are married now and have a little one, too.  That is great!  Are you still living in the San Diego area?
Hey Danielle!  It was so good to hear from you!!  I haven't kept in touch very well with my mom's side of the family and it has been so long since I have been back to WA.  I was so much older than all the other cousins (ok I am not that old but you know what I mean!)  that I feel like I missed out on getting to know everyone.  What are you doing these days?  How is your mom? Dad?  Brother?  I have three daughters Alexis 11, Torin 7 and Kyra 15 months.  They are so much fun!  I know they would think it was so cool to spend some time with some 'older' cousins if we went to WA to visit!  take care angela
U too a Rare Piece in this World........... Trust me its jus Wonderful havin u as my Friend......Thanks a Lot......

rambout.
When do you want me to have their party?  Mom called and wants to know when.  I wrote Lori, so the two of you need to discuss it together, geez, you guys act like you have five kids and work 52 hours a week like me!  Sat is the tourney at Stow, and I am not sure when it will be over,  so I would say like 6pm, but I am not sure if that is too late, what should I feed you guys?  I am really not in the mood, I could care less, but they want a bday party so I have to give them something
As we've discussed this day only means you are one year closer to death, so really how great is it? But since that is not standard to write on someone's wall, have a "Happy" birthday.
Hey, RaeAnn.  Are you up?
Hi Jacob -  I hope you are doing , by your photo you look happy and healthy !  Its 4 years since Austin died , it is still a tremendous 
shock , its always there . I miss him so much , he would have 
liked this FaceBook ! Tell me how your doing ?
I am in California , visited Nick in LA , he is doing well .
Take care and please always keep Austin alive in your thoughts and
memories . Be blessed , Wanda
Feeling any better?

Thanks for the kind words!  I can't believe you stayed in Vegas too!  I thought you went back to Reno after grad!  Where did you live?  I can't believe we never ran into eachother!  My ex and I bought a house in 1999 down in Rhodes Ranch and he still lives there.  I worked for a few years after UNLV at Trader Joe's as a manager, then went back to school to get my masters and become a teacher.  During that time, we decided to start a family and I stayed home for almost 5 years!!  But I had to get back to work....it was tough being a stay-at-home mom!  The divorce caught me way off-guard and it's been a tough road, but I am finally starting to feel like my old self again :)  Any kids in the near future for you???  I love your Tahoe wedding!  I was just in Tahoe in February.  My grandpa lives up there, so we went to visit him and take the girls to the snow!  Did you teach in Vegas?  Great to hear from you too!  Don't you love catching up with old friends??

ACK! I go to the vet all the time too. 3 times since last Saturday. UGH! Alfie is a horror about taking medicine - he has an upper respiratory infection. Now I'm just sticking a pill in tuna fish. Seems to be working, but now he won't eat anything but tuna fish. Sigh. Also, Bucky has a yeasty ear so i had to get him meds. Looking forward to the warmth of L.A. Richard is already there - I leave tomorrow. There is supposed to be 36 people at the Seder. Should be interesting. Ciao for now

HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!
Hey bro, sorry, life's been a bit mad - i was literally back in Newcastle for four days. I did bump into 14 people i knew over those four days, but they were all 3-minute conversations, and it wasn't the same without you, dude.

I'm not hugely exciting, in the middle of revision for Final exams so life has been swallowed up in work, mostly. But i now know what i'm doing next year, which is a big weight off my mind, and it's nice to know that i've only got 5 more weeks of hardcore English left. How about you? What's new on your end?

okay okay okay. he came here right? lol i was planning on talking to him about whatever happened. but he brought it up. he said sorry and all that. when he was about to leave we started talking about it again. he said he knew i wanted him too so he did, and then after he did he started thinkin about it and like freaked himself out (those are moms words lol) but it was sweet bc he also said that he didnt wanna rush into a relationship with me n mess it up n us ending up like him and his ex gf are now. they dont talk. and when he said that stuff like 'idk yett' when i asked him if he still felt the same way, well i took it the wrong way. he was being his aggravating self as he calls it. he brought that part up too. i didnt tell him that made me mad till after he told me that. then i laughed cuz he silly. yep yep soooo  were good now. =)

I watched Return of the Jedi earlier, and the Ewoks made me think of the Hobbits...which in turn made me think of you! They're still gay, you know. Flaming. Not that there's anything wrong with gay Hobbits, of course. But Frodo needs to just pull out his rainbow flag and admit it!

How was the birthday celebration?
Wow, you're amazing!  What kind of soaps and lotions do you make?   So sweet (and funny ) of you to latch onto Ryan's idea! I'll see what we can rescue from the pile.  They got rained on, so I'm not sure of the condition they'll be in.  They are not the super large ones like you find in Michael's.  If you want, I can take a picture of them to see if they are the kind you'd like.  Let me know, you crafty crafter!
hey I don't think we are going to meet you for dinner. So we'll see you at kemper.
if that's what he has to do to get his team fired up, so be it.  But the important part is, nobody that matters recognizes it as a Big 12 title.
hw r u?wth do u do?
10ish - come if you want it is low key
Alpi jeleeek...
um so Im glad you made it back to campus and are alive and well. I am currently not stressing and not working on anything, hence facebook. I believe I have reached numb. It is a wonderful feeling where you stop caring. I am truly enjoying it. Sooooo Maureen and Katie are for sure coming up to maine and they are thinking the first week in june... so I am thinking we should plan a trip to camden for a couple of those days and go to the state park and hike a couple hills. Good? good. 

ps Tyson's comment makes me happy about our weird random adventures. 
pss We apparently left a voicemail for brian screaming about how your brother is a year older than us and I am only 20 and do not yet wish to have a baby.

LOL

Yesterday I was showing my friends from college my friends from home...obviously as one of my best you came up pretty quickly. Aside from a unanimous consensus that your profile pic is hott, they all agree that you seem like you'd be fun to hang out with. I told them they have no idea;). A-N-Y-W-A-Y lol I actually just realized that I don't need to use our anyway rerouter to get back on topic bc there is no bitchbitch to cut me off :D...lol really back on topic though we definately need to hang out when I get back from exams in the beginning of May...I'm thinking we could blare Crack a Bottle...the part where they say "we ball out'a control like you wouldn't believe" particularly reminds me of us :)...anyway I'll come pick you up at that ghetto college of yours so you can show off when you get into my car and we drive away w the music blaring:D
haha maaf maaf . ntar gua anggep deh .

FINE. The Tarentines who originated out of the tribe of Achilles asked Pyrrhus, the king of Epirus help against the Romans. He soon came to italy and for the first time the romans fought with enemies from overseas. Pyrrhus won with the help of elephants, which, unknown, the romans greatly feared. However the king, moved by the admiration of the romans, said: if we will have conquered the romans again, we all will die. And, his hands having been raised to the sky, with such soldiers, he said, I could have been the master of the whole world. Pyrruhs gave the captured romans the greatest honor, he buried the killed. Ambassadors sent to Pyrrhus concerning the captives were received with the greatest honor. He sent the captives back to Rome without ransom. He wanted one of the ambassadors of the romans, fabricius, who was neither eager for mercy nor forgetful of his homeland. And so Py, moved by the large admiration of the romans, sent an ambassador to seek peace by means of fair terms,

Hi Linus, I skimmed some of the bill (HR 875) and it doesn't appear to target small or family farmers but on the other hand it does not seem to exclude certain types of farms (small, organic, family, etc.). That's what it should do if it is only intended for large commercial oversight.
i can't believe you remember that!!! omg great times :D
thanks dada

I was going to make some alfredo pasta with brocolli mixed in.  That is something all the kids like.  I will make sure there's plenty so Chelsea can eat too.   If she doesn't like it she can raid our cupboards for food!!!  Thanks for getting back to me.  We love you all and will plan on tomorrow!

Saat mau login akun FACEBOOK, pastikan anda masuk pada: https://www.facebook.com/  BUKAN, http://www.facebook.com/ ATAU, www.facebook.com/ ATAU, facebook.com/  Mengapa???? Sebelum jawab mengapa, saya tak peduli anda aware ato tidak pada jawaban ini.. 

Bertujuan mengamankan aktivitas facebook kita dari intersepsi (eavesdrop) pihak2 tak diundang.. Aktivitas facebook seseorang berarti menunjukkan transmisi paket data dari komputer bersangkutan menuju server facebook. Transmisi paket data itu mengandung username dan password tatkala pertama kali login, dan selalu pula mengandung KTP sementara seseorang itu (disebut cookies) saat sedang bermain2 facebook alias blom logout. Perlukah ini DILINDUNGI?? Jawabannya ada pd diri masing2.. Sebab, pihak Facebook sendiri sudah menyediakan sertifikat SSL Enkripsi RC4 128-bit untuk melindungi paket data tiap penggunanya di internet. Penggunaan sertifikat SSL ini diterapkan dengan cara mengetikkan HTTPS://www.facebook.com/   Sudah pernah kena sadap??

THANKS FOR THE ADD :) BTW, DO I KNOW YOU?
iloveyouiloveyouiloveyou!
Can you tell I'm tired?  I was trying to make your birthday more Scandinavian by adding the 'j' to it...LOL!
Just a thought.....have you e-mailed Kathy W. to see if she has info on facts about the Nelligan ancestors????  I know..No time....I just thought she might have some interesting facts, or maybe old pics to put in.....Catch you later....OH--I'm ticked....Can't find my old family tree notes...Probably filed them away in a "safe" place...Wherever THAT may be....LUV U
I want some God damn Waffle House! Stop being a loser, get out of bed, and come to Waffle House with me!! I'm hungry. This is important. If I go by myself and "get stolen" it is going to be your fault, and you will no longer have a girlfriend because I will be beaten to death, chopped up, and left in a freezer. In that case, no one will find me for 20 years, I will be on A&E Cold Case, and I hope that you remember to please get on piknic.com and update my hairstyle for the show!! That is very VERY important!!!!
As we type.
HA!!!!! I told you I would......lol......I love your profile by the way.....
kommt maria auch mit? :)

Hi Kally. There is a tax rebate available for first time home buyers. They can amend their 2008 tax refund to get a credit of 10% of purchase price up to  $8,000. You don't have to re-pay this one. If they qualify. You need to consult an accountant to see if you do. It my be worth contacting one. Some are not charging to do that. Give them a call to see first.  But I do believe you already owned a home prior?
Thanks Trevi.  I am spinning out big time!
bahah

thank u so much:)
Way to go girl-friend!  I was only on for a minute last night.. What are your plans for the weekend?
this week sucks for me but lets definitely do something next week !
oh my bad.. did i spell it wrong? lol! and what do you MEAN he bores you?!! kwento! i need updates!
I'm excited too... I'm ready to be out of the old middle school.. Nasty.. We've caught tooooo many mice...
As for the year, its almost over! I thought I would be really excited, but its more stressful and sad than anything else. With 8 AP tests around the corner and the realization that I'm never going to see a good majority of my friends again I'm kinda freakin out. Leaving the comfort zone of home and high school is a big shock and alot harder than imagined. As for school I'm almost certain that I'll be attending Boston College in the Fall, as long as I can make tha money work out. I really am excited because I know Boston is the place where I want to be but I still need to convince myself that life will go on without high school. I'm just feeling all the normal high school junk. Now that I've rambled about myself how bout you? Whats it like in Bangkok right now with all the turmoil?
Happy Birthday
Hehehe.....na bado....

Was that a very large alarming bump/bruise I saw on your head? I'm glad you were taken care of- obviously I don't know any of the circumstances or what in the world happened... but as long as you're doing better is all that matters. 

haha- yeah i wasn't too worried when you didn't know my name- the paramedics were freaked out- but I tried to reassure them that no, we hadn't lived together for two years, so it wasn't a big deal. 

everything is well for me. i'd love to run into you again without you on the ground with two paramedics and oxygen!

Miss you Dez! Thank you for the birthday wishes and the narrative of who I look like. LOL. I look like a monkey and I can even climb trees like a monkey... You do know you friends.. love yah
bener ko van gue udah jadian ko tp gacerita 
i agree.. but think it's more important to mention; they obviously are confused sad individuals who cross dress in their ex-wife's clothing, wear makeup and most likely get hair tips from the emo girl sitting next to them. Fuck the bitches that don't actually know what friendship is, and that need a man to validate them because they are so ugly and snaggle toothed that they are happy any man could pay attention to them! Fuck em!
makasi y ud add..
ini sapa y?

i lovee youu
where have you been I thought we were all supposed to get together for your birthday and riri's and then i never heard anything from youu
I am trying this new fangled method of communicating.  I was trying to avoid it.  I don't want to feel obligated to look at it all the time.  However, I am seeing I am able to talk to friends easier this way.  With our busy lives this may be what I need to settle for at this time.  Heaven knows I don't write and goodness me I mean to call and then that doesn't happen.
ciao,  back to my online class tonight
heyy lenny!!!!!

it's your friggin birthday tomorrow. i can't even believe it. you're going to be sixteen. WOW. i'm excited to see you. and i will buy you a present sometime so that i can give it to you when i see you which is SOON. :D but for now all i can say is happy early birthday and i love you with a burning passion. i'll most definitely say happy birthday tomorrow. but i wanted to write a super duper long message on your wall before just because i'm bored. right now i'm backstage doing a run through of my play. i'm a cheerleader. :) hahaha, its so funny. i've got to be the ditziest girl ever. anyhoooo, life is boring over here. i have a VERY long story to tell you about loads of things. mostly boys, but i don't have a boyfriend, don't get excited. hahaa. and how goes it in TO ? oooh, and just a suggestion: don't get TOO drunk tomorrow night because i have a feeling you want to remember your sixteenth birthday party. well i'm running out of room to write. bye bye, see you soon !!

Yeah there were a lot of us green and gold folk on the trip, over half the group. I'm glad it wasn't more; we have an obligation to mingle with the peons from time to time, I suppose. And by golly it was a blast, just dense with amazingness. Only now I've caught the travel bug and I'm shit broke. Bad combo.

Yeah, man.  I just didn't like how the way the Viper's future looked.  They asked if any BIT guys were interested in transferring to heavies and I threw my name in the hat.  It was a tough decision to leave but I'm glad I made it.  Kyle Stewart and Chris Bohner went C-17's.  I'm stoked to get out there and start flying.  When do you head to Korea?
Great racks
I'll be getting in early Friday morning, around 7-ish, I think, and then leaving Sunday night.
This is so exciting!
Thanks! Hopefully, we will see you in May in Boston!

When you pass through the rivers they shall not overflow you. Whey you pass through the fire, you shall not be burned, neither shall he flame kindle upon you.

The Lord has called you by your name. Amen

Zee, they did stink.  And right now, they're only over .500 by 5 games.  They've been streaking the past two months which is why they're making the playoffs at that ranking, not to mention the Eastern Conference isn't nearly as good as the West.  They've been much stronger - which is fantastic, but I don't recant those comments, and nope, I don't want to get into an argument about it when we're rooting for the same team.

Te amo!
Nuestro amor es el mas Grande del Planeta!
Por que como te quiero no hay nadie que quiera!
Por que como te amo no hay nadie que ame!
Por que como me besas nadie besa a nadie!
Por que no hay razones para que se muera!
Este amor tiene tendencias a lo Infinito y esta Blindado contra el miedo el engaño y el olvido!
Esta muñequita que ahora tengo le ha quitado a mi vida la duda!
No hay como pagarle a Dios por tu cara bonita!
Por tu alma buena por tu dulce compañí­a!
Porque me ha regalado a la mejor mujer del mundo!
Y porque a nuestras vidas le palpita un solo corazón!

hello. I saw this on the front page. the joomla thing. If I can use it, you can. And I cant. KIDDING I can, the password and login are stored in my church email if you need. And you could email Joomla and ask them if you can use their hosting space to put your ready made thingy in there. I said hosting space! I am so technological. Fluent in Adobe...anything.
miss me?
Bonne fête encore bibi.

Sweet, r the kids comming with you? yea we'll definetly have to get together, Destinys 17 & graduating in may can u believe it?  Lazanay just turned 13 & Lena's now 2. So do you still talk to mike much? or are ya'll on a parenting basis only? He calls every once in awhile to say hello, is it true he got married?
how are you doing tonight
not good me time today...my car broke down and i washed a load of clothes with no detergent, lol, but i did make it on time to get my hair done so thats good news
Happy birthday! Hope it's filled with joy and many blessings. Have fun!!!
deuh...
celana bau..
hehe,, baru maksudnya,,
bau toko euy..
ahahahahahaha!!! *dies* that's too funny!
but seriously tho... do you know what you'd have to do? just be charming and entertain, or would customers have license to treat you not so nice? cuz i can see it being like that, where business men get drunk and become degrading towards you, but your boss might get mad if you talk back, etc... you could always give it a shot and quit if you don't like it.
i'm still amused tho... with our fascination with hosts... you being a hostess... oh boy, i'd come to japan just for that! :P
Thank you so much for coming to the opening reception "Visual Voice".  It meant a lot to me having your support. visualvoicesculpture.blogspot.com

Thanks for sharing the Sandcook website. Your Hallibut sound really good. The boys reck the gardens but I make container gardens on the upper deck and works good.  A herb garden sounds like a good idea I will have to check that out.  I'm the cook of the family and usually don't use recipes.  It's all instinctive, however some of my dishes turn out to be what I call emocallause.
Prob no Jim, just me... and Otto and a buncha other random vail folks. Should I count ya in? Can you get the days off?
hahaha, kamu yang sabar ya sayang =)
buruaan ya, jangan lama2 di sana ntar lo ketinggalan hot gossip lagi haha

Hello Marc...hope you're seeing spring already.  Lewiston has been in bloom for some time as you can imagine.  I planted my garden, the lettuce is up an inch, I overwintered some plants as well and they should be ready for harvest soon.  Made my way down to Boise via Lowman for a meeting this week.  The elk are prolific in Lowman, well and the wolves are strong too.   Hope you are well.

yay for Saskatchewan? Funny actually, last night i went to see a stand up comic who was from Sask. He was pretty funny (and i think partially hammered). We havent had snow here since...beginning of march, i think?

Im doing good, finishing up the semester, getting a small break before the cycle repeats itself (summer classes). Working on more art than i've ever done so in such a short period of time but it feels good.

So when's your next trip down to the 514?

Hey Meg, I noticed your posting about the Iowa Supreme Court, and then I was looking at my friend Peter's info and he is a member of one of these "groups" on facebook.  I'm not sure what all of that is about, but anyway, the first one in the list I found to be quite hilarious so I thought I'd share it with you...maybe you would want to join it or something...I don't know.  Anyway, here's the title of the group:

Against Gay Marriage? Then Don't Get One and Shut the Fuck Up,
Cantik, ternyata kita udah friendnan loh??! Kok bs ya? Hihihihi, ga sadar gue. Jalan2 lg yuk syng, hihi. Eh ksitau lg don kelemahannya ochoe.psti td blm smuanya kan? Hihihi

well atm i'm in and out of hospital every week having treatment on my kidney which is blocked by what they beleive is a riddicliously large kidney stone.. ive had an operation to put a stent in so i wont be suffering from kidney failure anytime soon thank FUCK, but yeah its just a bit uncomftorble and it can be real painfull. so dancing was a nogooo.

yeah it really is a shame, the course itself was good and i enjoyed it but i just don't think i was upto the standard of work really, sucks.

i'm working at the nursery i used to work at a few years ago as a nursery teacher atm, although obviously having been rather ill ive been having a fair bit of time off atm :/ but yeah, pays my way (:  xx

varlığımı tanımlamak adına yeni sıfatlar yaratabilmeliyim.
kurumuş yaralarımın kabuklarını söküp arşivinize katmakla
elde ettiğiniz hazza anlam veremedim. ben cahilim.
beni sevmek için programlanma, devrelerini yakarım.
şu an deli misal aşığım, bir kişi hariç herkese şaşıyım.
unutma kurşun her gülümsediğinde bir kalp ağlatır.
korkusuzluk sahipleri neden kemer arkasında silah taşır?
telefon çaldı, ne yazık ki iyi niyetlerine meşgule verdim.
çığlık atan bu duvarlar tarafından asıl rahatsız edildim.
bildiklerimi şarkılarımda yüksek sesle dile getirdim.
kaprislerimin tadını çıkarıp kinlerimi boğar durumdayım.
gün batımına ekilen tohumların haddi, hesabı yok.
bana benden başka bir dost varsa bilmem lazım.
aşkım güven ödülüme en yakın adayım.
son doğum günümde kendime yeni bir ben aldım.
umarım kaderin bitiş çizgisinden uzağım tanrım! umarım tanrım
man we shud make a group of people who are bored and have nothing better to do...i assure you...i surpass ur lvl of being bored here at home :(

Jim Drown a revivalist from the states was speaking. Him & his wife Kathy run an orphanage of 400 in Peru. Amazing couple. Mis you mighty man.

Det er så varmt oppi den vognsoveposen hennes at hun har kun på det hun har på den dagen, som oftest bomullsbody, sokker og bukse. Kanskje en hettegenser el lue. Men merker at hun er helt våt av svette noen ganger, så vil ikke ha på henne for mye klær heller! 
Ja, hadde 3mndsvaksinen fredag før påske og neste omgang er nå den 16. Det gikk kjempebra. Hun merket ikke sprøytene engang.  Hun var litt trøtt den dagen men ellers helt som før:) IKKE noe å grue seg for iallefall! Var bare kos å veie og måle henne, og se på så mange andre søte barn som var der samtidig:):) Lykke til!
iyaaaaa mi .

Muchas gracias por contemplarme en tu estudio. Hoy Carlos Pozo se refirió al tema y me comentó su interés en visitarte el día viernes 17, ante lo cual me animé. Tentativamente estaríamos visitandote a las 9.30am del dicho, ahora, como IHQ termina el martes 14, a partir del miércoles 15 tengo recreo citopatológico, por lo que no descarto tener miércoles y jueves disponibles. Hablaré con Carlos y evaluaré mi situación para forzar una visita a tu laboratorio el jueves 16.
¡Suerte en tus investigaciones!

How can you survive without me??? No one can say "Bu... Va..." to you after 4/24. I'm sad........
Since you've done such a bang-up job with the port tips, I will ask you for some ship tips. ;-) Is there any restaurant to avoid or time of day when it's best to go to a certain restaurant? I'm so freaked out about picking up some dirty stomach virus on board. And what about the pool -- any time to get there before it fills up? Anything on board you think is a waste of time (like shows or other events?) I'd love to get a massage on board, but they charge an arm and a leg for the massages! Thanks SOOOO much again. ;-)

Oh baby walking already, that's cute as man!  Hey isn't it his birthday soon???  I came home a few weeks ago to see how Mum was as she had been sick but you know her she's hard as a rock!  The weekend was awesome you were missed!  Hope mahi is going well for you and you're getting use to the Night shift.  Keep in touch and much love to you guys always xoxo
BTW- what did he do?
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Take care, bud, you Cokers are a tough bunch!  Hey, how did you find such a pretty and talented secretary?
haha yeah thats what they say. my spring break wasn't that bad. i stayed here and babysat a few days. the little boy i watch is so cute. we played pirates, watched veggie tales, and played with his trucks in the dirt everyday. im not gonna lie, it was pretty awesome. i mostly hung out with some of my friends and with my grandma. thats how cool she is. one day kk and i took her over to her sisters house and they were looking at old pictures from when they were in highschool. they were all making fun of people in their grade. it was hilarious. im kinda sad that school started again but its almost summer so its not so bad. how was yours?
Hey Helen - glad to see you on facebook.  I've had a great time finding old friends and looking at photos.  Pretty cool.  Can't wait to see photos of Hayden on here!  Love ya.  Kim
im good!
i know we havent...
i just found nathans facebook hahah
are you in school right now or are you on a break?
Oh anytime, Perrin.  That sounds fascinating.  I would be thrilled to receive a lengthy textual update of your life, especially if involves something vaguely along the plotline of Darjeeling Express (okay, at least the India and train part...)  But I can only receive texts of 160+ characters from fellow Verizon users, so you better be "in."
Nice photo of your puppy.   Happy to be your friend on facebook.   What sun?
happyb'day bro
heyyyyyyyy supp?
Be prepared to shop 'til we drop tomorrow! And spend ALL Fred's money!!

So I'm doing a persuasive speech for a class about tattooing.  Can I use this quote from you?

"My advice is look for cleanliness, look through artists books...Tattoo shops generally have more than one artist and those artists tend to specialize in certain kinds of tattoos. This is simple, and can probably done well by any kind of artist, but still. See what's out there. You might get some awesome ideas from the artist to help spice it up. As far as regretting it, I figure, we all come into the world with the same general body. I want mine to be a reflection of where I've been. I probably won't get too many more...Maybe one or two...And I don't want them completely visible...But I like my tattoos. They're mine and they represent my personality on my outward appearance. I say go for it. =) Let me know how it goes!"
Happy 30th Birthday Donna.... lol!!!!

Finally done. Did you use the other one for parts? That's one way to get the parts without having to go out and buy them. I've done the same thing with bicycles. I have a bike that I bought  a few years back, but i didn't like the brake setup, so I took the brakes off an oloder bike my brother gave me, that was about 20 years old.

Great to hear from you.  Things here are great with the family.  Baby # 3 is our son Wes who just turned 2 last month.  Hannah is 7 and Brooke is 12 and they are doing great as well.   We're all praying that the economy will turn around soon because so many people are being affected, but we always remember who is in control, and it is all in His timing.  Facebook has been great at reconnecting, so I look forward to keeping in touch.
I love that picture of you and Gavin!!! Whats up? are you off work for the day?
hey girl, how are you? I have not talked to you in a while!
Happy Birthday!!

Just got home yesterday and am feeling better each day.  I know I still have a long row to hoe with chemo etc. but I am trying to keep the best light possible on it considering it will be awhile before I will know the outcome.  One day at a time is my motto at the moment.

Could I take any more quizzes on this thing? I am so bored and don't really want to do anything so instead I find myself wasting away the night taking useless quizzes to find out what Saved by the Bell character or Muppet I am. I will now sleep better tonight Knowing that I am Kelly from Saved by the bell. Wonderful... the world can continue spinning now! :) I hope you have a good night!

I'm an easy-going person, clean, responsible, no drama, no drugs and organised.
Please let me know if you're interested.
Thank you,

That is hilarious!  I guess if you don't see live/active lava...it could kind of look like a desert and not a volcano!  Maui has so many different climates, from the dessert like volcano, so the really rich and green mountains.  I felt like I was in Ireland, the Rocky Mountains, and the dessert all on different days.  Pretty amazing for such a little island!  That's great you got to go there!

Hey Scott, good to see you on facebook. Did not find out about it until about 2 months ago. Hows your son doing? He is probably 13 by now I guess. I am still managing the Italian restaurant. It has been about 15 months now. Still see some of the people from the hotel from time to time. Really miss the people, but not the B.S. Take care

We sing a lot over here in the Pacific Northwest where the ocean and mountains are...it's kind of wierd. We REALLY like the Happy Birthday Song. Specially Grama's Taco Billy. (I have pics of him doing that; just pretend he's singing to you tonight, okay)? :)

haha, thanks. and um.. jeez, i don't know. i think maybe i'll go see a movie or go to bayshore or something, because mayfair has that rule thing and my birthday is on a saturday... umm i'm not sure. we should all do something, though! like you could meet me there or something. yeah, that would be super fun :] i just hope my mom's in a good mood that day, because if she's not then she won't drive me anywhere. haha. man, i wish i could drive. drew can't drive yet either because he won't go and take the test, which makes no sense because he's gonna be 17 in september rotfl,.. so that kind of sucks. haha. but we could always do something on the 17th... it'd just have to be in the afternoon because i have something going on in the morning. and then we could just, like, go wherever or something. but yeah, call me and we'll set something up for this week :D i tried your cell yesterday... but i think it was, like, dead or something. idk, i'm dumbb :P
I wish I could have been there. I heard yall had fun next time I'm sneaking Vin in the venue
