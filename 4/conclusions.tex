From the analysis in the report body, it is concluded that:\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item Sentiment is a useful metric to track, but is difficult to track accurately.
	
	\item The first iteration is useful is time applications, whereas the third iteration is useful in accuracy applications.
	
	\item The recall rate is not affected by which iteration used, but can be improved by increasing the size of the sentiment keyword library.
\end{itemize}
