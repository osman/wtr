	\item Time and resources should be spent on increasing the sentiment keyword library, so that the recall rate improves.
	
	\item At least one member of the team should research more applications of user sentiment in areas such as advertising or suggestion-making based on user preferences.
	
	\item At least one co-op student from an engineering program should be given the project of developing a parsing infrastructure that breaks down the messages by grammar and context, allowing for highly accurate results.
