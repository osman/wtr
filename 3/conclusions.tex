\section{CONCLUSIONS} % (fold)
\label{sec:conclusions}
From the analysis in the report body, it is concluded that:\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item There are a number of bottlenecks and common errors that impede the proper functionality and full efficiency of a kdb+ database system.
	
	\item The bottlenecks of RAM, swap space, hard drives, partitioned tables, iterative operations and load-balancing gateways all work to increase the overall efficiency and minimize the runtime of a query.
	
	\item Each of the concepts discussed work to minimize the amount of time required to maintain the kdb+ system, from a upgrading and maintenance standpoint.
\end{itemize}
