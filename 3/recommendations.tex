\section{RECOMMENDATIONS} % (fold)
\label{sec:recommendations}
From the analysis in the report body, it is recommended that:\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item Should a company be able to afford purchasing extra hardware, more RAM and hard drives should be purchased to minimize hardware bottlenecks as hardware bottlenecks are the most restrictive of any of the other bottlenecks.
	
	\item At least one member of any team that uses kdb+ should have additional training and sound knowledge of kdb+ through seminars.  They should then review any software written to minimize hidden bugs.
	
	\item At least one co-op student from an engineering program should be given the project of actually applying and testing these changes to a kdb+ system.
\end{itemize}
